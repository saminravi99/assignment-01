                <p>Web Development - 2022. My passion is solving problems. I thrive when tasked with a challenge, and
                    love digging into a
                    problem to find the root cause. The web has been an exciting place in recent years, and I'm eager to
                    continue learning
                    it as more features are created and new ideas are formed.</p>

                        to make beautiful and user-friendly web experiences for others. You are in charge of showing the
                        world who you are.

                    <p>The scope of a web developer is different than that of a web designer: A web designer's work
                        focuses on improving the
                        visual appearance of a website, and creating an intuitive user interface. Web designers build
                        the structure,
                        stylesheets, and layout on which the server-side implementation will be based. That said, many
                        web developers are also
                        capable or utilizing web design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Dreamweaver, or
                        Microsoft FrontPage to
                        build their HTML websites.</p>
